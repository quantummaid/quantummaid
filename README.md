# QuantumMaid

The go-to application framework for Beginners, Domain-Driven Designers, Clean Architects, Monolithics, Microservicers, Servlet Grandpas, Docker Hipsters and Serverless Junkies.
 
## Designed for Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design
QuantumMaid stays completely out of your business logic.
It explicitly does **not** require you to:
- Add annotations to your code
- Inherit base classes
- Implement framework interfaces

In fact, you can bundle your entire business logic into a dedicated module without any dependency
to the application framework.
This enables you to implement Domain-Driven Design by the book.
More information can be found [here](https://quantummaid.de).

## Getting started
You can find easy-to-follow and interesting tutorials [here](https://github.com/quantummaid/quantummaid-tutorials/blob/master/README.md).

The QuantumMaid documentation can be found [here](https://quantummaid.de/docs.html).
