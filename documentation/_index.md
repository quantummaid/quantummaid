The go-to application framework for Beginners, Domain-Driven Designers, Clean Architects, Monolithics, Microservicers, Servlet Grandpas, Docker Hipsters and Serverless Junkies.
 
## Designed for Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design
QuantumMaid stays completely out of your business logic.
It explicitly does **not** require you to:
- Add annotations to your code
- Inherit base classes
- Implement framework interfaces

In fact, you can bundle your entire business logic into a dedicated module without any dependency
to the application framework.
This enables you to implement Domain-Driven Design by the book.

## Quick Start
This documentation gives an in-depth explanation on all of QuantumMaid's features. 

For an easy start with QuantumMaid, the [15 Minute Tutorial](https://github.com/quantummaid/quantummaid-tutorials/blob/master/basic-tutorial/README.md)
might be the best option.
